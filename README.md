# Cain-Jawbone-API
That`s a .NET API created for storage all evidences and theorys in my run trying to solve the Cain Jawbone Book

The idea behind this project was a Mobile App where i can centralize all my theorys about Cain Jawbone organized in a simple structure where i can search for relationships between Pages, Charactes, Evidences, Theorys in my Journey

The end of this is a Mobile app but this project is the API behind all of this
